Introduction

I run Mediatomb DLNA server with my PS3 as the client. I am working towards 
importing my entire DVD and Blu-Ray collection into my Mediatomb server. 
However, my wife wants to know something about each film in the library without 
having to dig out the DVD case from storage. My solution is to include a MPEG 
video displaying the film summary in the Mediatomb library for each DVD I have 
imported so it can be easily viewed from the PS3.

Usage

  IMDB-to-MPEG.php -t "Move Title" -i 1234567 -o m4v -r 864x480 movie.mkv

You can also pass several optional arguments
  -a    : Automates execution by answering all prompts with the default response.
  -t    : Provide a film title to search for.
  -i    : Provide an IMDB ID to search for.
  -o    : Set the MPEG output format: m4v (default), mp4, m2v or mpg.
  -r    : Set the MPEG output resolution: 864x480 is the default.
  -d    : Enable debug mode.
  -h    : This help.

This scripts requires at least one argument as input, the filename of a file. 
By default the script will try to lookup the film based on the filename you
provided. In addition you can provide some optional arguments to help find the 
correct film. For example...

Search by title by passing the optional title argument -t. If the film title has 
spaces it should be wrapped in double quotes.

 ./IMDB-to-MPEG.php -t "Usual Suspects" ~/Videos/The_Usual_Suspects.mpg
 
Search by IMDB ID by passing the optional IMDB ID argument -i 
 
 ./IMDB-to-MPEG.php -i 0114814 ~/Videos/The_Usual_Suspects.mpg 

The plotline, year of release, genres, cast list and running time for that film 
are gathered from IMDB and formatted as text. You'll be prompted to confirm that
this is the film you are seeking. Here is an example.

---
The Usual Suspects (1995)

A boat has been destroyed, criminals are dead, and
the key to this mystery lies with the only
survivor and his twisted, convoluted story
beginning with five career crooks in a seemingly
random police lineup. (106 mins)

Starring Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus,
Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, Benicio Del Toro as
Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney, and
Kevin Spacey as Roger 'Verbal' Kint.

Genres: Crime, Mystery, Thriller.

Rated 8.7 out of 10 from 227,964 votes.

Use this movie [Y/n]:

The first IMDB entry that matches the search string will be used, which works 
fine most of the time so long as the title string is accurate. Should the search 
result not be the film you are looking for you can select an alternative from 
the list provided. Once a film has been selected the text is converted into a
series of image and then encoded into a MPEG video. 

The default behaviour is to encode a MPEG-4 video at a resolution of 864x480.
You can optionally encode the video as MPEG-2 video. For example:

 ./IMDB-to-MPEG.php -t "Usual Suspects" -o m2v ~/Videos/The_Usual_Suspects.mpg

You can also change the resolution of the MPEG video independantly of the video 
format. For example:

 ./IMDB-to-MPEG.php -t "Usual Suspects" -r 640x480 ~/Videos/The_Usual_Suspects.mpg
 ./IMDB-to-MPEG.php -t "Usual Suspects" -r 720x576 -o m2v ~/Videos/The_Usual_Suspects.mpg

Directories for each matching genre are created and also one for the IMDB rating
(rounded down). The MPEG is stored in the 'All' folder and then sym-linked to 
the genres and rating for that film. You will be prompted if you want the film 
you supplied as input should be copied into the appropriate directory in 'All'.
You will end up with something like this.
